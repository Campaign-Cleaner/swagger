        that can be set, all optional settings, if not specified will default to
        the bold/italicized setting.


        All submitted campaigns will be sanitized and CSS inlined.


        #### Request Body:


        _Required:_


        **send_campaign**:


        - **campaign_html** : The full HTML of your campaign

        our sanitization checks.
         

        Campaigns are normally processed in under 2 minutes, in most instances
        in a few seconds. But in some cases with very large campaigns with lots
        of images and links it can take longer to check those links for
        blacklists, redirects. image sizes and more. Depending on the server
        where those links resources are located it can take longer. The send
        campaign, will return a campaign ID once we received it, you can use
        that campaign ID to check on the status, and retrieve your campaign when
        it's finished processing or you can supply us a webhook URL and we will
        send the results to you automatically.


        _Optional:_


        **send_campaign**:


        - **adjust_font_colors**: (_**true**_/false), If true, certain bright
        colors are spam triggers, like "**red**" or "**#FF0000**", will be
        adjusted to a slightly different color like "**#FF0101"**, it will look
        the same, but won't trigger some spam filters.

        - **adjust_font_size**: (_**true**_/false) If true, you will be able to
        define the min and max font size allowed in pixels. If your newsletter
        contains larger or small font's it will adjust them to the min/max you
        define.

        - **convert_h_to_p_tags**: (true/**false**) If true, this will change
        all the H tags to P tags and set the correct font-size.

        - **convert_tables_to_divs:** (true/**false**) - This is an experimental
        feature to convert all the tables to divs, in certain instances with a
        complicated table structure you might need to edit the HTML. We
        recommend leaving this as false or not setting it.

        - **custom_info:** This field is for you to pass any additional data you
        want to send us, it will also be passed back to you when you call the
        get_campaign API. It's limited to 500 characters. - It must pass our
        sanitization checks.

        - **host_extensionless_images:** (true/**false**) If true, images
        without extensions will be hosted on our CDN when the
        **resize_and_host** parameter is set to true. Typically, dynamically
        generated images lack extensions, though there are exceptions.

        - **image_max_width:** (int) When this is specified, it will add an
        max-width style to all images. it is not desirable for the image width
        to exceed the default campaign width.

        - **min_font_size_allowed**: (_**10**_) (A positive Integer, under 100)
        The **min_font_size** must be smaller or equal to the **max_font_size**
        in pixels

        - **max_font_size_allowed**: (_**32**_) (A positive Integer under 100)
        The **max_font_size** must be larger or equal to the **min_font_size**
        in pixels

        - **remove_classes_and_ids**: (_**true**_/false) If true, removes all
        the class and ID attributes after CSS Inlining.

        - **remove_comments**: (_**true**_/false), If true, comments are
        stripped from both CSS and HTML. Comments are invisible in html and can
        trigger spam filters.

        - **remove_css_inheritance**: (_**true**_/false) If true, removes all
        elements of CSS that are inherited. Once CSS is inlined, the inherited
        CSS will be removed, for example if font-size of a parent tag is 15
        pixels, there is no need for the font-size of the child tag to be
        specified as 15 pixels because it's inherited or computed from the
        parent tag, this reduces the size of your HTML Campaign.

        - **remove_control_non_printable:** (**true**/false) If true, all
        non-printable and control characters are removed.

        - **remove_image_height:** (**true**/false) if true, the height style is
        removed from all images, preventing any image distortions. Only the
        width property should be set on images sent in emails.

        - **remove_large_widths_over**: (integer) Experimental: If sets removes
        all defined widths over the value set on non images and table tags.

        - **remove_successive_punctuation**: (true/**false**) if true, this will
        remove succession punctuation like ..., !!!!, $$$ to a single
        occurrence.

        - **relative_links_base_url**: If set this needs to be a full base URL
        like "[https://campaigncleaner.com/"](https://campaigncleaner.com/), if
        your email campaign has any relative paths, it will be converted to an
        absolute URL. In most instances, you won't need to set this.

        - **replace_diacritics**: (**true**/false) If true, replaces diacritic
        characters like á with normal characters equivalent, if you're sending
        emails in English emails, this is a must.

        - **replace_non_ascii_characters**: (**true**/false) If true, replaces
        all non-ascii characters with their ascii equivalent. For example, ❝
        will be replaced with **".** Non-ascii characters is of of the major
        spam trigger.

        - **resize_and_host**: (true/**false**) If true,we will resize, convert,
        and host all eligible images on our CDN. Please read our documentation
        here: [Resizing and
        Hosting](https://docs.campaigncleaner.com/en/resize_and_host)

        - **surrounding_div:** When you set any parameter of the surrounding
        div, it will add "div" tag around your html with the styles you set.
        This is helpful to set default styles and conditions that can affect the
        look of your html.
         - **max_width:** The max_width style applied to the surrounding "div" can be specified in pixels as an integer value. It is typically set to the desired maximum width of the campaign, which is commonly either 600 or 900 pixels.
         - **text_align**: (left, center, right) All content within the surrounding "div" will be aligned according to your specified style. However, you can use the "text-align" property on inner tags within the "div" to customize the appearance of your email.
         - **font_size:** The pixel size that you want everything in the surrounding div to adhere to, setting this, will add an "_!important"_ to the font-size in the surrounding "div". Font sizes that are set on any tag in the HTML will retain their original size. While all unspecified font sizes to the size you chose.
         - **center_to_parent:** (true/false) Using this feature will enable the surrounding "div" to be centered in any parent tags in which it is placed. This is particularly helpful when inserting an HTML snippet into a template.
        - **treat_as_fragment**: (**true**/false), If true, all information
        before and after and including the body tag is removed.

        - **webhook_url**: An endpoint that you provide us and when your
        campaign is fully processed we will send the results back that is found
